The Color LED tab lets you control the Color LED deck(s) attached to your Crazyflie. Use it to select colors, adjust brightness, and create custom lighting effects. You can conrol one or multiple decks, save your favorite colors to a palette, and see real-time messages from the deck about its status.

The tab is divided into 3 sections:
1.  Deck Position
2.  Color Selection
3.  Deck Information


### 1. Deck Position
Select the version of the color deck connected to your Crazyflie: **bottom**, **top**, or **both**.
If you have both decks attached, you have the option to control them independently or simultaneously.


### 2. Color Selection
Select the color you want to display on your Color LED deck(s). You can either:

* Enter a HEX value, or
* Pick a color from the Hue/Saturation/Brightness (HSB) field.

When you find a color you want to save, click the (+) button to add it to your color palette.


### 3. Deck Information
This field displays messages from the Color LED deck. For example: 

```
Throttling: Lowering intensity to lower temperature.
```
