This page is intended to give an overview on how to use the Crazyflie
client, not for installing it. For install instructions go
[here](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/blob/develop/README.md).

The Crazyflie client is used for controlling the Crazyflie, flashing
firmware, setting parameters and logging data. The main UI is built up
of a number of tabs, where each tab is used for a specific
functionality.

This page uses the terms
[roll/pitch/yaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics_(fixed_wing_aircraft))
extensively. For that to make any sense for a quadcopter we need to know
where the front is ([Crazyflie
1.0](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie:userguide:index#the_crazyflie), [Crazyflie
2.0](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie2:userguide:index)).

How to get flying
=================

-   Start up the application
-   Insert the joystick and Crazyradio (PA)
-   Before you connect to the Crazyflie make sure that the joystick is
    working as expected and that the **thrust is zero**. The joystick
    values should be visible in the flight data box under target.
-   Press *Scan*
-   Wait for the scanning to complete
-   In the drop-down menu to the left of the Connect button select the
    Crazyflie you want to connect to. Connect to the URI e.g.
    radio://0/80/250k.
-   The client will now connect to the Crazyflie and handshake
-   When the handshake is done you can start flying the Crazyflie.
    Remember the most tricky part is the thrust so start out easy\...

For more info on LED indicators etc. have a look at the
[Crazyflie](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie:userguide:index#the_crazyflie) or
[Crazyflie 2.0](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie2:userguide:index) user guide.

Main UI
=======

![CF client main](/images/cf_client_1.png)

1.  The window title will show the connection status
2.  Connect/disconnect, scan and the drop-down connection list as well
    as Address and auto reconnect.



       * *Scan:* Will scan for availible Crazyflies within the chosen address.
       * *Connect:* Will connect to the selected URI in the connection list
       * *Disconnect:* Will disconnect the current Crazyflie
       * *Address:* The address to scan for. If you didn't change this [in the configuration]( https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:client:pycfclient:index#firmware_configuration), then leave the default of 0xE7E7E7E7E7
       * *Auto Reconnect:* Try to automatically reconnect when connection is lost.
    - Battery and link quality (from 0% to 100%)
    - Tabs with specific functionality (see below for details)
    - The selected and used input interface

Functionality
=============

Below are a few guides on how to accomplish specific tasks with the
client.

Firmware upgrade
----------------

For updating the Crazyflie firmware there\'s the possibility to enter
bootloader mode and flash [new
firmware](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/misc:downloads:index) from within the
client. The bootloader mode is accessed from the menu
*Crazyflie-\>Bootloader*. If there is any problem during the flashing or
a wrong firmware is flashed the process can just be started again.

![CFclient bootloading](/images/crazyflie_bootloading.png)

To update the firmware in the Crazyflie 1.0/2.0 do the following:

-   Make sure that the Crazyflie is disconnected from the client and
    powered off
-   Go to the menu *Crazyflie-\>Bootloader*
-   For Crazyflie 2.0 hold the button for about 3 seconds when turning
    it on until the blue LED M2 starts to blink to get into bootloader
    mode. If a wrong nRF51 firmware has been flashed you might have to
    start from an un-powered state. Then hold the button and connect
    power.
-   Click \"Initiate bootloader cold boot\"
-   For Crazyflie 1.0 now power it on **within 5 seconds** using the
    battery (not USB), the booloader should now connect
-   Press \"Browse\" and select the binary you want to download *(e.g.
    cflie.bin)*. **Note:** A \*.bin file will be flashed to the STM32xxx
    only. Or select a [zip](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:bootloader:index) file
    containing firmware for both nRF51 and STM32F405 for Crazyflie 2.0
    as well as firmware for the STM32F103 for the Crazyflie 1.0.
-   Press \"Program\" and wait
-   Press \"Restart in firmware mode\"

To check the firmware version, under the *View* menu, open up
*Tabs-\>Console* tab and look at the output when connecting to the
Crazyflie 1.0/2.0.

Firmware configuration
----------------------

It is possible to set another channel to communicate with the Crazyflie
1.0/2.0. It can be wise to do this if there exist other wireless
networks that can interfere, especially WiFi. It is also possible to
permanently store the trim values for pitch and roll.

It is currently possible to change the following parameters which are
stored in a none volatile memory:

-   **Pitch trim** Can be programmed permanently with the trim values
    found to work good in the flight tab.
-   **Roll trim** Can be programmed permanently with the trim values
    found to work good in the flight tab.
-   **Radio channel** Can be set to anything between 0 and 125,
    correspond to a frequency from 2400MHz to 2525MHz. In most countries
    channel 0 to 80 is OK to use but this should be checked with you
    local regulations. If using 2M datarate, the copter channels should
    be 2 apart (2MHz).
-   **Radio bandwidth** This can set the radio bandwidth to 250k, 1M or
    2M. A lower bandwidth has longer range but has higher chance of
    collision. When used inside sometimes it is better to use 1M or 2M
    as it decreases the risk of collision with WiFi.
-   **Radio address** (advanced) will set the shock burst address used
    for communicating. Note that if you change this then you will have
    to set the address correctly in the connect dialog.

The procedure is described below and the parameters can be changed again
any time the same way.


|     **Crazyflie 1.0**                                                |                        **Crazyflie 2.0**  |
|-----|------------|
|   Click on the menu **\"Crazyflie-\>Configure 1.0\"** and then connect the bootloader by clicking on the \"cold boot\" button and by restarting the Crazyflie.  | First connect to the Crazyflie 2.0 with the normal connect button. Then open **\"Crazyflie-\>Configure 2.0\"** to reach the configure 2.0 dialog   |
 |    ![CF1 config](/images/configure_cf1.png){:width="500"}             |                                                                      ![CF2 config](/images/cfclient_cf2_config.png){:width="500"} |
   |  Once the settings has been made press the program button to save them permanently in the Crazyflie flash.              |                                        Once the settings has been made press the write button to save them permanently in the Crazyflie 2.0 EEPROM.    |


Logging
-------

The Crazyflie logging framework allows to log the state of Crazyflie
variables in real-time. This subsystem is used by the client to show
information like pose or battery level.

The list of log variable can be seen in the \"log TOC\" tab in the
client.

Variables are logged in block: one log block is a list of variable that
are logged at the same time. You can setup custom log blocks that can be
plotted in the plotter and saved to file in the log block tab.

To setup a new log block click on the menu \"settings/logging
configuration\", You then see the following toolbox:

![cfclient logging configuration](/images/client_log-configuration_anotated.png){:align-center}

1.  List of log variable in the Crazyflie
2.  Log variables in the current log block
3.  Add the selected Crazyflie log variable in the log block
4.  Remove the selected log block variable from the log block
5.  Period at which the variables are sampled and the block is send by
    the Crazyflie to the client. The minimum possible period is 10ms
    (100Hz) and it can be set by step of 10ms up to 2550ms.
6.  Space taken by the variables in the log block.
7.  Name of the new or existing log blocks. You can choose an existing
    block from the list or type the name of a new one
8.  Load existing log block configuration
9.  Save log block configuration

Flight settings
---------------

By using the settings on the [Flight control
tab](#flightcontrol) you can set
things such as the max roll/pitch and thrust.

Input devices
-------------

In order to control the Crazyflie you are connected to you will need
some input-device. Normally this would be a gamepad, but any
input-device with at least 4 analog axis will do. Here\'s [a
list](/userguides/inputdevices/) of some input-devices
that are used.

In order to make sense of the input from the device a mapping has to be
supplied. This mapping will convert raw axis values on the input-device
to useful values like roll/pitch/yaw/thrust. There\'s a few default
mappings shipped with the client, but it\'s easy to create your own.

### Creating new mappings

The software comes bundled with mappings for Xbox and PS3/4 controllers,
but if you have another input-device then it\'s quick to create your own
configuration. Go to the menu *Input device -\> Configure device
mapping*.

![cfclient configure device](/images/cfclient_devconfig_select.png){:align-center
width="700"}

Select the device you would like to configure and press *Configure*.

![cfclient configure device axis](/images/cfclient_devconfig_axis.png){:align-center
width="700"}

For each functionality that can be mapped there\'s a *Detect* button, by
pressing it the following dialog will appear.

![cfclient configure device detect](/images/cfclient_devconfig_dialog.png){:align-center
width="300"}

Follow the instructions to detect the axis or button that you would like
to map to the functionality. If you would like to map the functionality
to two axis (like right/left sholder-button) then select *Combined axis
detection* and follow the instructions.

Go though all the functionality you would like to map by pressing the
*Detect* button for each. To be able to save the mapping you will at
least have to map roll, pitch, yaw and thrust.

![cfclient configure device feedback](/images/cfclient_devconfig_feedback.png){:align-center
width="700"}

Once you have mapped functionality you will be able to see the feedback
directly in the configuration dialog (when you\'re not detecting a
button). Make sure to check that the response is what you intended. When
you are finished with the mapping then enter the map name and press
save.

If you would like to start from a previous configuration and change it
(either to update or to create a new one) then select the appropriate
mapping in the drop-down and press *Load*. Once you have made the
changes you would like to do then either press *Save* without changing
the name to update the mapping or enter a new name and press *Save* to
create a new one.

### Selecting device

The current input device and mapping can be selected from the *Input
device* menu.

The *Input device* menu contains a number of different \"modes\" that
can be used for controlling a Crazyflie. Currently there\'s thee to
choose from. The alternatives will only be enabled if there\'s enough
input devices connected to use them.

-   *Normal:* Just like it says this is the normal mode using only one
    controller to control a Crazyflie
-   *Teacher (RP):* This mode requires two input-devices, where one will
    be configured for roll and pitch and the other one for the rest of
    the functionality. By using the *Mux switch* functionality (mapped
    in the configuration) the second controller can take over roll and
    pitch as well
-   *Teacher (RPYT):* This mode requires two input-devices, where one
    will be configured for roll, pitch yaw and thrust, and the other one
    for the rest of the functionality. By using the *Mux switch*
    functionality (mapped in the configuration) the second controller
    can take over roll, pitch, yaw and thrust as well

For normal usage just enter the *Normal* menu, select the device you
would like to use and the correct mapping. As a device is selected the
list of mappings are enabled.

![cfclient devices normal](/images/cfclient_input_normal.png){:align-center
width="700"}

If more than one input device is connected then it\'s possible to switch
to one of the teacher modes.

![cfclient devices mux select](/images/cfclient_input_mux_select.png){:align-center
width="700"}

First select the device that should be used for the teacher and then
it\'s mapping.

![cfclient input teacher](/images/cfclient_input_teacher.png){:align-center
width="700"}

Then select the device that should be used for the student and then
it\'s mapping.

![cfclient input student](/images/cfclient_input_student.png){:align-center
width="700"}

Once this is done you will be able to see the open devices and
configurations at the bottom of the user interface.

![cfclient input mux configured](/images/cfclient_input_mux_configured.png){:align-center
width="700"}

Tabs
====

The main interface is built up of different tabs that can be
shown/hidden from the *View-\>Tabs* menu.

Flightcontrol
-------------

The normal view used when flying is the one seen below.
![cfclient flighttab](/images/cfclient_flightab.png){:align-center}

1.  Flight mode selector (Normal and Advanced)



       * *Normal:* Recommended for beginners
       * *Advanced:* Will unlock flight settings in 3
    - Assisted mode selection. The assisted mode is enabled when the assisted mode button is pressed on the Gamepad.
       * *Altitude hold*: Keeps the Crazyflie at its current altitude automatically. Thrust control becomes height velocity control.
       * *Position hold*: Keeps the Crazyflie at its current 3D position. Pitch/Roll/Thrust control becomes X/Y/Z velocity control.
       * *Height hold*: When activated, keeps the Crazyflie at 40cm above the ground. Thrust control becomes height velocity control. Requires a height sensor like the [Z-Ranger deck](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie2:expansionboards:zranger).
    - Roll/pitch trim can be set either in the UI or using the controller (if the correct buttons are mapped). This will offset the input to the Crazyflie for correcting imbalance and reducing drift.
    - Advanced flight control settings are available if Advanced mode has been selected (settings are in %):
       * *Max angle:* Set the max roll/pitch angle allowed
       * *Max yaw rate:*Set the max yaw rate allowed
       * *Max thrust:* Set the max thrust allowed
       * *Min thrust:* Minimum thrust before 0 is sent to the Crazyflie
       * *Slew limit:* Set the percentage where the thrust is slew controlled (the thrust value lowering will be limited). This makes the Crazyflie a bit easier to fly for beginners
       * *Slew rate:* When the thrust is below the slew limit, this is the maximum rate of lowering the thrust
    - Settings for flight decks, currently the LED-ring effect and headlights can be set (if the ring is attached)
    - Target values sent from the client for controlling the Crazyflie
    - Actual values logged from the Crazyflie
    - Motor output on the Crazyflie
    - Horizon indicator

Plotter
-------

The plotter tab can be used to visualize data logged from the Crazyflie
![cfclient plotter](/images/cfclient_ploter.png){:align-center
width="700"}

1.  Select logging configuration to plot. Read about how to create
    configurations \<here\>.
2.  Legend for the logging configuration that is being plotted.
3.  Logged data, zooming and panning can be done with the mouse.
4.  Number of samples showed in the plot. After this is filled the plot
    will start scrolling the data
5.  Auto-scaling or fixed scaling for the Y-axis
6.  Auto update graph. If this is disabled the plot will stop updating
    (but data will still be collected in the background)

Parameters
----------

The Crazyflie supports parameters, variables stored in the Crazyflie
that can be changed in real-time. The parameter tab can be used to view
and update parameters. For more information about parameters see
logging and parameter frameworks LINK TO CF-FIRMWARE!

![cfclient parameter list](/images/cfclient_param.png){:align-center
width="700"}

1.  Parameter information fields



       * *Name:* The name of the parameter or group.
       * *Type:* The C-type of the variable stored in the Crazyflie (you cannot set values outside this)
       * *Access:* RW parameters can be written from the client while RO parameters can only be read
       * *Value:* The value of the parameter
    - Group: To make things easier each group has it's members organized as sub-nodes to the group
    - Parameters: The full name of each parameter is the group combined with the name (group.name)

Log blocks
----------

The log blocks tab shows all log configurations that are saved and if
they are started. It\'s also possible to start/stop them as well as
write the logged data to file.

![cfclient log blocks](/images/cfclient_logblocks_marked.png){:align-center
width="700"}

1.  Fields
    -   *ID:* Block id in Crazyflie
    -   *Name:* Block name in client
    -   *Period:* The period of which the data is sent back to the
        client
    -   *Start:* Marked if started, click to start/stop block. Note that
        some of the blocks are used for the user interface, so if they
        are stopped the user interface will stop updating
    -   *Write to <file:*> Marked if writing to file, clock to
        start/stop writing. The data will be written in the
        configuration folder for the client (see \<here\> how to find
        it).
    -   *Contents:* The variables contained in the block (named by
        group.name)
2.  Information for log configurations are folded by group by default,
    opening them up will show in detail what variables are in the group

 The data written to file will be in
the configuration folder under *logdata*. Each directory is timestamped
after when the client was started and each file timestamped after when
the writing to file was started (i.e starting/stopping and
starting/stopping again will yield two files in the same directory). The
data logged to the file is in CSV format with the headers for the data
at the top. A timestamp is automatically added for each entry and shows
the number of milliseconds passed since the Crazyflie started (sent
together with the log data).

Example data
of what\'s logged when logging the battery level:

    Timestamp,pm.vbat
    9103,3.74252200127
    10103,3.74252200127
    11103,3.74252200127
    12103,3.74252200127
    13103,3.74252200127



Console
-------

The console tab will show printouts from the Crazyflie firmware as it\'s
running.
![cfclient console](/images/cfclient_console_marked.png){:align-center
width="700"}

1.  Console output from the Crazyflie

Loco Positioning
----------------

The Loco Positioning tab shows information from the Loco Positioning
system when present.

There are three graphs showing 2D projections of the system from three
directions. The top left graph shows the system from above, the bottom
left shows is it from the front (along the y-axis) while the bottom
right shows it from the right side (along the negative x-axis). The
graphs can be zoomed and scrolled.

The tab can be used in two modes that is selected with the radio buttons
to the right

To setup the LPS anchor system mode (TWR or TDoA), see the [Configure
LPS positioning mode wirelessly](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:lps:configure-mode) documentation.

### Position estimate mode

Displays the configured anchor positions and the estimated position of
the Crazyflie. Can be used to make sure the system is set up correctly
and that the estimated position is reasonable.

![cfclient positioning](/images/cfclient_position_estimate.png){:align-center
width="700"}

1.  Plot for X/Y (top view) showing anchors and Crazyflie
2.  Plot for X/Z showing anchors and Crazyflie
3.  Plot for Y/Z showing anchors and Crazyflie
4.  Sets the graph mode
    -   *Position estimate* - Normal viewing mode
    -   *Anchor identification* - Enhanced mode where anchor id and
        marker becomes larger when Crazyflie is closer
5.  Indicates if anchors are communicating with Crazyflie (i.e anchors
    are up and running)
6.  Fit and center all data in graphs
7.  Used to set anchor positions (see below)

When setting the anchor position there\'s three colors to indicate the
status:

-   *White* - No position exists for this anchor (i.e the position has
    not been read yet)
-   *Red* - Position has been read from the anchor and it differs from
    the currently shown value in the input box
-   *Green* - Position has been read from the anchor and it is the same
    as the currently shown value in the input box

The positions of the anchors is continuously read in the background and
as positions comes in or input box values changes the colors will be set
accordingly. There\'s also two buttons used for the settings:

-   *Get from anchors* - Fills the input boxes with the positions read
    from the anchors
-   *Write to anchors* - Writes the currently shown values in the input
    boxes to the anchors. In order to check that the write has been
    successful wait about 10s and all the fields should turn green as
    the positions are read back. If some of the fields are still red,
    try pressing the button again.

### Anchor identification mode

displays the configured anchor positions. When the crazyflie is close to
an anchor this is indicated in the graphs by highlighting it. This mode
is useful to identify anchors and verify that the system is correctly
configured.
![cfclient anchors](/images/cfclient_anchor_identification.png){:align-center
width="700"}

1.  Plot for X/Y (top view) showing anchors and Crazyflie
2.  Plot for X/Z showing anchors and Crazyflie
3.  Plot for Y/Z showing anchors and Crazyflie
4.  Sets the graph mode
    -   *Position estimate* - Normal viewing mode
    -   *Anchor identification* - Enhanced mode where anchor id and
        marker becomes larger when Crazyflie is closer
5.  Current system mode indication. The system must be in TWR mode for
    the anchor identification mode to be available.

ZMQ backends
============

The UI is normally used to get/set parameters, view logged data and send
control commands to the Crazyflie. Aside from this there\'s also the
possibility to connect via ZMQ to the client and control several things:

-   [Parameters](/functional-areas/cfclient_zmq#parameters):
    Get/set parameters by name
-   [LED-ring memory](/functional-areas/cfclient_zmq#led-ring):
    Write LED ring memory
-   [Input-device](/functional-areas/cfclient_zmq#input-device):
    Act as an input device

The benefit of using this approach instead of the [stand-alone ZMQ
server](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:client:cfzmq:index) is that you will not have to
take care of everything, just the parts you are interested in for the
moment. An example is [this video](https://vine.co/v/eZ3jZqxmeZh) where
the light/sound is controlled via ZMQ though the client, but everything
else is like normal (flying, input device, etc).
