_Only use this type of firmware flashing if you crazyflie is not booting up properly. Check [the cfclient userguide](/docs/userguides/userguide_client/index.md) for the official instructions._

For updating the Crazyflie firmware there\'s the possibility to enter
bootloader mode and flash [new
firmware](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-release/releases) from within the
client. The bootloader mode is accessed from the menu
*Crazyflie-\>Bootloader*. If there is any problem during the flashing or
a wrong firmware is flashed the process can just be started again.

To update the firmware in the Crazyflie 2.X do the following:

-   Make sure that the Crazyflie is disconnected from the client and
    powered off.
-   Go to the menu *Crazyflie-\>Bootloader*
-   Select the \"Cold boot (recovery)\" tab in the dialog.
-   Press and hold the power button on the Crazyflie for about 3 seconds. The blue LED (M2) starts to blink to indicate
    the Crazyflie is in bootloader mode. If a wrong nRF51 firmware has been flashed you might have to
    start from an un-powered state. Then hold the button and connect power.
-   Click \"Initiate bootloader cold boot\" in the client
-   Select the latest release from the drop down menu or the file if you have downloaded it from the [Github release page](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-release/releases).
-   Press \"Program\" and wait (do not restart the crazyflie until it is finished.)
-   Press \"Restart in firmware mode\"

_Be aware that no deck firmware be updated in this mode, so please use the [the cfclient userguide](/docs/userguides/userguide_client/index.md) after you have recovered crazyflie._
