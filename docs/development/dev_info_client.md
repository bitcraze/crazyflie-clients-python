This page contains generic information about various topics that might
be interesting while developing for the Crazyflie Python client. The
same kind of information is available here for the Crazyflie Python API.

Here\'s a quick overview:

-   The GUI is made in QT4 (using QTDesigner 4 and loading the .ui files
    at runtime)
-   It uses the SDL2 to read input devices on Windows/Mac OSX and raw
    jsdevs on Linux. It also supports custom input from
    [LeapMotion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) and
    [ZMQ](http://zeromq.org/).

Input devices
-------------

The architecture for the input devices in the client strives to give as
much flexibility as possible and to make cross platform compatibility
smooth. It combines raw readings from input devices with input device
mappings to create control values for the Crazyflie and the application.
It\'s also possible to input control values directly.

Below is a walk though of every step of the process, from reading the
device to sending the control values to the Crazyflie.

### InputDevice

There are two ways to get input into the client: Input readers and input
interfaces. On startup the modules *lib/cfclient/utils/inputreaders* and
*lib/cfclient/utils/inputinterfaces* are initialized and these
directories are scanned for implementations that can be used. Each
python file in these directories represent a \"backend\" that handles
input. Each backend can have zero, one or multiple devices that it can
control. The *inputreaders* module is used to read normal
joysticks/gamepads while the *inputinterfaces* module is used to read
any custom interface that\'s not a joystick/gamepad.

Once the backends are found the client tries to initialize each backend.
If successful it is scanned for devices, otherwise it\'s quietly
discarded (only printing a message to the console). A structure is build
where the dependency is reversed (backend-\>device to device-\>backend)
and a list of devices (with connected backends) is passed on.

The client can now open any device in the list and read it. If the
device is from the *inputreaders* module a mapping has to be supplied as
described below.

#### Input readers

Currently there\'s two types of *inputreaders*: SDL2 and Linux. The
Linux backend is used on Linux and SDL2 on all other platforms. In order
to use the devices connected to the backend a mapping has to be supplied
to translate the raw axis/buttons indexes (0, 1, 2..) to usable values
(roll/pitch/yaw/thrust..).

#### Input interfaces

The input interfaces don\'t use any mapping, the devices itself directly
generate useful values (like roll/pitch/yaw/thrust). Currently there\'s
two implementations: LeapMotion and ZMQ. Values are read the same way as
from normal gamepads/joysticks, at 100Hz. For more information on how
the ZMQ interface works read [here](/functional-areas/cfclient_zmq#input-device).

Files
=====

To support the application there\'s a number of files around it, such as
configuration and caching. All these use JSON to store information. All
of the user configuration files are stored in the */conf* directory.
Most of the files have default versions in the */lib/configs* directory
that are either copied at the first start up or used in parallel as
read-only copies to complement what ever is stored in the user
configuration directory.

User configuration file
-----------------------

To save the configuration between runs of the application there\'s a
configuration file (*/conf/config.json*).The file is updated while the
application runs and settings change. Below is an example of the
configuration file.

``` {.json}
{
  "client_side_xmode": false,

  max\_rp                    float     Max allowed roll/pitch (degrees), only applicable in Advanced mode

Default configuration file
--------------------------

The source code contains a default configuration file
(*/lib/cfclient/configs/config.json*). The file contains two parts: The
default writable part and the default read-only part. When the
application is started for the first time (and */conf*/ doesn\'t exists)
the writable part of this configuration file is copied to the
*/conf/config.json* file to create the default values. The read-only
part is used for settings that cannot be changed, but shouldn\'t be
hardcoded in the code. When the application starts and both the user
config in */conf/config.json* and the read-only part of
*/lib/cfclient/configs/config.json* is merged so they can all be
accessed in the application.

``` {.json}
{
  "writable" : {
    "input_device": "",
    "link_uri": "",
    "flightmode": "Normal",
    "open_tabs": "Flight Control",

    "default_cf_channel": 10,
    "default_cf_speed": 0,
    "default_cf_trim": 0
  }
}
```

TOC cache files
---------------

In order to speed up the connection procedure for the Crazyflie the TOCs
are cached ([more info on logging/parameter frameworks and
TOC](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/) ). The writable part of the TOC
cache is located in */conf/cache* where each cache is saved in a file
named after the CRC32 (in hex) of the TOC CRC32 (for example
*1CB41680.json*). There\'s also a read-only part of the TOC cache
that\'s located in */lib/cglib/cache* and contains the caches for
official builds. When the application connects to a Crazyflie the CRC32
of the log and param TOC is requested. When the client receives it will
check if a file with the correct name exists (in both the RW and the RO
TOC cache). If it does it will load the cached TOC, if not it will start
requesting the TOC from the Crazyflie and when it\'s done it will save
it in the cache.

The TOC cache files are organized in a hierarchical manner after the
*group.name* concept. In the examples below you first see the group
*acc* which contains the variables *y*,*x*,*z*,*zw* and *mag2*. Each of
these variables have a set of attributes that are described below.

 |  Field          |        Format |   Comments|
  | --------------| ------- | --------|
|   ident               |   int     |  The TOC id of the variable|
|   group               |   string  |  The group the variable belongs to|
|   name                |   string  |  The name of the variable|
 |  prototype           |   string  |  The Python unpack string of the variable used when unpacking the binary data|
 |  [class]{.underline} |   string  |  The name of the class that can hold this variable (either LogTocElement or ParamTocElement)|
  | ctype               |   string |   The variable type in the firmware|
 |  access               |  int    |   The access restrictions mask for the variable (only applicable for parameters). 0 = RW, 1 =  RO

Below is an example of part of the log TOC cache:

Input device configuration
--------------------------

Input device configurations are used to map raw axis (integers) to
values such as roll/pitch/yaw/thrust (more info above). The
configurations are stored in */conf/input*, one file for each
configuration. The default configurations are stored in
*/lib/cfclient/configs*. The first time the configuration starts up (if
*/conf/input* doesn\'t exist) the default configurations are copied into
this directory and can then be used.

A raw axis can be mapped to one or more values, that way it\'s possible
to split up values on multiple axis. An example of this is using the
bumper buttons to control the yaw, where the left one controls CW
rotation and the right one controls CCW rotation.

Log configuration files
-----------------------

The user can configure custom logging configurations from the UI (more
information on logging/parameter
frameworks (/doc/crazyflie/dev/arch/logparam) ). These will be saved in
the */conf/log* directory, one file for each configuration. Default
logging configurations are stored in the */lib/cfclient/configs/log* and
are copied into the user configuration directory on the first status (if
*/conf/log* doesn\'t exist).

|  Field    |     Format |   Comments|
 |  ------------ | --------|
|   logconfig   |  dict  |    Contains a logging configuration|
 |  logblock    |  dict    |  A logging configuration|
|   name       |   string  |  A readable name of the configuration that will be shown in the UI|
|   period     |   int     |  The period the logging data should be requested in. Minimum resolution|  is 10th of ms
|   variables    | list    |  A list of dictionaries, one for each variable in the configuration |
|   name         | string  |  The full name of the variable in the group.name format |
|   type        |  string  |  Could be either TOC or Memory, currently only TOC is implemented |
|   stored\_as  |  string  |  The format (as C type) that the variable is stored as in the firmware |
|   fetch\_as  |   string   | The format (as C type) that the variable should be logged as |

Below is an example of a log configuration file:

``` {.json}
{
  "logconfig": {
    "logblock":
    {"name": "Stabilizer", "period":20,
     "variables": [

     ]}
  }
}
```
