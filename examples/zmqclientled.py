"""
Test script to show how to use the ZMQ LED-ring backend for the Crazyflie
Python Client. The backend is started automatically in the client if ZMQ
is available.

The example will fill up the ring by sending 12 message, each with a new
LED lit up, until all of them are lit up in the last message.
